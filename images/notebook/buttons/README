Hello dear reader!
In this directory are some buttons. Ultimately all buttons should be moved from other places and be kept here. 
But, for now, there are two button backgrounds here - one is 70x30 pix, other is 135x30 pix (files itself are a little bit bigger due to irregular borders), both available in normal and dark flavors. Those are made by Q_x and licensed accordingly to latest PARPG licensing scheme.
I added something for qubodup. 16x16 button is one thing - rules apply as above. Plus, extra button_flex_16* files is flexible-width button with left and right border elements and miggle part tileable horizontally.
