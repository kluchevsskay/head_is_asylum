Welcome, stranger!

This 40 files are tabs, or "Pieces of paper sticking out", made by Q_x for PARPGand licensed accordingly to the project's most recent licensing scheme.

5 separate tabs (named tab1* ... tab5*) are rotated in 4 directions (*bottom, *left, *right, *top) and available in 2 colour flavors - *normal* is normal stuff, *dark* is emphasized, hovered or special in any other way.

This tabs will work with both scalable and non-scalable notebook concepts.
Normal text (font, as it is in game) should easily fit onto the tabs.
